# Crosses and Roshambo
When life gives us lemons, we should make lemonade. After all why not in this scorching heat. 
Due to lockdown, the school and institutions were shut. However, it acted as an  opportunity for me. 
I learnt Java for Android Software Development and even more. 
Not only did it help me get a step ahead in understanding but it was a pure fun learning process. 
Here's my first project.
## About
The game has a number of English names:-
Tick-tack-toe, tick-tat-toe, tit-tat-toe, Naught and crosses, Ely - Ozie's.
A player can play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe (to win or at least draw) if, each time it is their turn to play, they choose the first available move from the following list.
If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row to win. If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent. A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing a corner move gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)
In this app there are three modes available .These are Human V/S Human ,Human V/S AI(Easy) and Human V/S AI(Hard) playing with variety types of players.
